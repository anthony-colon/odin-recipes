    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot, heat some olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced
        onion and minced garlic, and saut√© until the onion becomes translucent
        and fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the diced carrots, celery, red bell pepper, and zucchini to the pot.
        Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables
        begin to soften.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the rinsed lentils to the pot, along with the vegetable broth, diced
        tomatoes (with their juice), and tomato paste. Stir well to combine.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the soup with ground cumin, paprika, turmeric, dried thyme, salt,
        and pepper. Stir again to distribute the spices evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and
        simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the soup is cooked, taste and adjust the seasonings if needed. You
        can add more salt, pepper, or spices according to your preference.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the creamy lentil and vegetable soup hot, garnished with freshly
        chopped parsley. Accompany it with some crusty bread for a hearty and
        satisfying meal.
