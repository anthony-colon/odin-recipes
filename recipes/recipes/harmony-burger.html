    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven or grill to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Prepare the plant-based patty by combining quinoa, black beans, mushrooms, and aromatic herbs and spices in a food processor. Pulse until well combined but still slightly chunky.</li>
        <li>Shape the mixture into burger patties of your desired size and thickness.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on a greased baking sheet or grill grate and cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they are browned and cooked through.</li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking, prepare the vegan aioli by blending cashews and roasted garlic in a food processor until smooth and creamy. Add a touch of water if needed to achieve the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Slice the whole-grain buns in half and lightly toast them in the oven or on the grill.</li>
        <li>Once the patties are cooked, remove them from the heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Harmony Burger by spreading a generous amount of vegan aioli on the bottom half of each bun.</li>
        <li>Place the cooked patty on top of the aioli, followed by slices of tomatoes, lettuce, red onions, and caramelized pineapple rings.</li>
        <li>Add a slice of dairy-free cheese on top of the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the jalapeno-cilantro sauce over the entire creation.</li>
        <li>Place the top half of the bun on the burger.</li>
        <li>Serve the Harmony Burger warm and enjoy its vibrant flavors and textures!</li>
